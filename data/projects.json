Using real statistics for the past season of the NBA queried from the nba_api, players compete to take all their opponent's cards by choosing a game statistic which they think their player performed better at than their opponent.",
    "motivations": "Growing up, I could never dribble, shoot and throw passes across the court so it never occurred to me that it would be fun watching other people do it for a living.\n\nI followed e-sports occasionally and loved competing in rock climbing competitions, but it was only after getting sucked into the career of Michael Jordan in The Last Dance during the Christmas of my first year at UBC did I start to see how the narratives of sports can be so captivating.\n\nSince then, following the NBA and learning about different stars and eras has become a big hobby of mine. I love basketball, my friends love basketball and after watching friends obsess over player stats in their fantasy league, I thought it would be fun to turn that obsession with stats into its own game.",
