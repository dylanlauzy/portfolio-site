  "bio": "I grew up in Singapore where I served in the army for two years after high school and it was during all those strict, gruelling days of training where I had both my lowest lows and highest highs. Outside the bubble of school, I was forced to define for myself what I wanted to do with my time outside of training and often felt lost without something to work towards. After trying to fill the time with things that left me unfulfilled, I happened to come across books, podcasts, blog posts and videos on software companies and startups. I was consumed with learning more about all the ways bits were being leveraged to improve the world and started to take courses in data analytics and web development to explore this area of interest. Since then, I've been exploring how data and software can be applied to novel problems through my time in and out of school.",
